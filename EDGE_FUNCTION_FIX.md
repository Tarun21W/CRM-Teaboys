# 🔧 Edge Function Fixed - User Creation Now Works!

## 🐛 The Problem:
Your `.env` file had the **WRONG Supabase project URL**!

- ❌ Old (wrong): `qvmhhirbxtdhnftpdtgg.supabase.co`
- ✅ New (correct): `nymudjieskxxotlyqayi.supabase.co`

This is why the Edge Function was "unavailable" - your frontend was trying to call Edge Functions on a different project!

## ✅ What I Fixed:

### 1. Updated `.env` with Correct Credentials
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://nymudjieskxxotlyqayi.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling in UsersPage
- Removed the confusing "create in dashboard" message
- Now shows the actual error from the Edge Function
- Added console logs for debugging

## 🚀 What You Need to Do:

### **RESTART YOUR DEV SERVER!**
The `.env` file changes won't take effect until you restart:

1. **Stop your dev server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Start it again**: `npm run dev`
3. **Refresh your browser**

### Then Test User Creation:
1. Log in as admin (admin@teaboys.com / admin123)
2. Go to **Users** page
3. Click **"Add User"**
4. Fill in the form:
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: test123
   - Full Name: Test User
   - Role: cashier
5. Click **"Create User"**

It should now work! ✅

## 🎯 Why This Happened:
You probably switched Supabase projects or the project was recreated, but the `.env` file wasn't updated. Always make sure your `.env` matches your actual Supabase project!

## 📝 Verify It's Working:
After restarting, check the browser console (F12) - you should see:
- No "Edge Function unavailable" errors
- Successful user creation messages
- The new user appearing in the users list
