# 🔧 Unit Conversion Fix - RESOLVED!

## 🐛 The Problem:

When selling 2 cups of Dum Tea, the system was deducting:
- **500 liters** of milk instead of **0.5 liters** (500ml)
- **100 kg** of sugar instead of **0.1 kg** (100g)
- **100 kg** of tea powder instead of **0.1 kg** (100g)

This caused negative stock values!

## ✅ The Solution:

Added **automatic unit conversion** when deducting recipe ingredients.

### Unit Conversion Function:
```sql
convert_unit(quantity, from_unit, to_unit)
```

### Supported Conversions:

**Volume:**
- ml ↔ l (milliliters ↔ liters)
- cup ↔ ml (cups ↔ milliliters)
- cup ↔ l (cups ↔ liters)

**Weight:**
- g ↔ kg (grams ↔ kilograms)

### Conversion Rates:
- 1 liter = 1000 milliliters
- 1 kilogram = 1000 grams
- 1 cup ≈ 240 milliliters

## 🎯 How It Works Now:

### Example: Selling 2 Cups of Dum Tea

**Recipe (makes 10 cups):**
- Milk: 500 ml
- Sugar: 100 g
- Tea Powder: 100 g

**When you sell 2 cups:**

1. **Calculate batches needed:**
   - 2 cups ÷ 10 cups/batch = 0.2 batches

2. **Calculate ingredient quantities:**
   - Milk: 500 ml × 0.2 = 100 ml
   - Sugar: 100 g × 0.2 = 20 g
   - Tea Powder: 100 g × 0.2 = 20 g

3. **Convert to product units:**
   - Milk: 100 ml → **0.1 L** ✅
   - Sugar: 20 g → **0.02 kg** ✅
   - Tea Powder: 20 g → **0.02 kg** ✅

4. **Deduct from stock:**
   - Milk: 2 L - 0.1 L = **1.9 L** ✅
   - Sugar: 2 kg - 0.02 kg = **1.98 kg** ✅
   - Tea Powder: 2 kg - 0.02 kg = **1.98 kg** ✅

## 📊 Stock Reset:

I've reset your stock to correct values:
- **Milk**: 2 L
- **Sugar**: 2 kg
- **Tea Powder**: 2 kg

## 🧪 Test It:

### Before Fix:
```
Milk: 2 L
Sell 2 Dum Tea
Milk: -98 L ❌ (WRONG!)
```

### After Fix:
```
Milk: 2 L
Sell 2 Dum Tea
Milk: 1.9 L ✅ (CORRECT!)
```

## 📝 Important Notes:

### 1. Recipe Units vs Product Units
- **Recipe can use any unit** (ml, g, cup, etc.)
- **Product can use any unit** (l, kg, pcs, etc.)
- **System automatically converts** between them

### 2. Best Practices
- Use consistent units when possible
- Recipe: ml, g (smaller units)
- Product: l, kg (larger units for storage)
- System handles conversion automatically

### 3. Supported Unit Pairs
✅ ml ↔ l
✅ g ↔ kg
✅ cup ↔ ml
✅ cup ↔ l

❌ kg ↔ l (can't convert weight to volume)
❌ pcs ↔ kg (can't convert pieces to weight)

## 🎉 Result:

Now when you sell products:
1. ✅ Correct ingredient quantities are deducted
2. ✅ Units are automatically converted
3. ✅ Stock levels stay accurate
4. ✅ No more negative stock!

**Just refresh your browser and try selling 2 Dum Tea again** - you'll see the correct deductions! 🚀

## 📊 Verification:

After selling 2 cups of Dum Tea, check stock:
```sql
SELECT name, current_stock, unit 
FROM products 
WHERE name IN ('Milk', 'Sugar', 'Tea Powder');
```

Expected result:
- Milk: ~1.9 L (was 2 L)
- Sugar: ~1.98 kg (was 2 kg)
- Tea Powder: ~1.98 kg (was 2 kg)

Perfect! ✅
