## 🛡️ Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)

### Phase 1: Audit Logging (To Implement)

Create audit log table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  resource_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  resource_id UUID,
  old_values JSONB,
  new_values JSONB,
  ip_address TEXT,
  user_agent TEXT,
  status TEXT, -- success, failure
  error_message TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_user ON audit_logs(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_action ON audit_logs(action);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_created ON audit_logs(created_at);
```

### Phase 2: Activity Monitoring

Track these events:
- ✅ User login/logout
- ✅ User creation/modification
- ✅ Product CRUD operations
- ✅ Purchase creation
- ✅ Sales transactions
- ✅ Stock adjustments
- ✅ Production runs
- ✅ Failed login attempts
- ✅ Permission violations

### Phase 3: Security Alerts

Monitor for:
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Unusual transaction amounts
- After-hours access
- Bulk data exports
- Permission escalation attempts
- Suspicious stock adjustments

### Phase 4: Compliance & Reporting

- User activity reports
- Access logs
- Data modification history
- Security incident reports
- Compliance audit trails
