# RLS Issue Fixed ✅

## Problem
Users couldn't view pages except POS and Dashboard due to RLS policy issues.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Missing RLS Policies on audit_logs Table
- Table had RLS enabled but NO policies
- All queries to audit_logs were being blocked
- Affected any page that tried to log actions

### 2. Missing User Profiles
- profiles table had 0 rows
- Auth users existed but no corresponding profile records
- RLS policies check profiles table for role-based access

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Added RLS Policies for audit_logs ✅
```sql
-- Allow all authenticated users to view
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to view audit_logs"
    ON audit_logs FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING (true);

-- Allow admin to manage
CREATE POLICY "Allow admin to manage audit_logs"
    ON audit_logs FOR ALL
    TO authenticated
    USING (role = 'admin');
```

### 2. Created Missing Profiles ✅
```sql
-- Auto-create profiles for existing auth users
INSERT INTO profiles (id, full_name, role, is_active)
SELECT 
    id,
    COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', email),
    COALESCE((raw_user_meta_data->>'role')::user_role, 'admin'::user_role),
    true
FROM auth.users
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE profiles.id = auth.users.id);
```
