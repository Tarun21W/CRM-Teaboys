# Dashboard, Production & Reports - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Page (DashboardPage.tsx)
**Problems:**
- Date filtering not working correctly for "today's" sales
- Low stock comparison using incorrect Supabase syntax
- Stats not updating properly

**Solutions:**
- Fixed date range to use proper `gte` and `lt` comparisons with tomorrow's date
- Changed low stock query to fetch all products and filter in JavaScript
- Improved data fetching logic with proper error handling

### 2. Production Page (ProductionPage.tsx)
**Problems:**
- Batch number generation using non-existent RPC function
- No automatic stock deduction for ingredients
- No automatic stock addition for finished products
- Production cost not calculated

**Solutions:**
- Implemented client-side batch number generation with timestamp
- Added automatic ingredient stock deduction based on recipe quantities
- Added automatic finished product stock addition
- Implemented production cost calculation from recipe ingredients
- Added proper scaling factor for batch sizes

### 3. Reports Page (ReportsPage.tsx)
**Problems:**
- Page was completely empty (placeholder only)
- No reporting functionality

**Solutions:**
- Built complete reports system with 4 report types:
  - **Sales Report**: Daily sales breakdown with totals and averages
  - **Product Analysis**: Product performance with revenue and profit
  - **Stock Report**: Current stock levels with valuation and status
  - **Profit & Loss**: Financial summary with profit margins
- Added date range filtering
- Implemented CSV export functionality
- Created summary cards with key metrics
- Added proper data aggregation and calculations

## Test Data Added
