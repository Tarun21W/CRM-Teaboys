# Automatic Customer Tracking System ✅

## Overview
The system now automatically tracks and updates customer statistics whenever a POS sale is made.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. Dashboard Real-Time Updates
The dashboard automatically refreshes every 30 seconds and shows:
- **Today's Customers Count** - Updates immediately when new sales are made
- Counts unique customers by phone number (primary) or name (fallback)
- Counts walk-in customers (sales without customer info) separately

### 2. Customer Statistics Auto-Update
When a sale is created with customer information:

**Trigger 1: Link Sale to Customer**
- Runs BEFORE INSERT on sales table
- Automatically finds customer by phone number
- Links sale to customer_id if customer exists

**Trigger 2: Update Customer Stats**
- Runs AFTER INSERT on sales table
- Updates customer's `total_purchases` (adds sale amount)
- Updates customer's `last_purchase_date` (sets to sale date)
- Creates new customer if phone provided but customer doesn't exist

---

## 📊 Customer Counting Logic

### Dashboard "Today's Customers" Calculation:

```typescript
// Count unique customers by phone or name
const uniqueCustomers = new Set()
let walkInCount = 0

sales?.forEach(sale => {
  if (sale.customer_name || sale.customer_phone) {
    // Use phone as primary identifier, fallback to name
    const identifier = sale.customer_phone || sale.customer_name
    uniqueCustomers.add(identifier)
  } else {
    // Count each walk-in sale as a separate customer
    walkInCount++
  }
})

const totalCustomers = uniqueCustomers.size + walkInCount
```

### Example:
**Today's Sales:**
- Sale 1: Rajesh Kumar (9876543210) - ₹100
- Sale 2: Rajesh Kumar (9876543210) - ₹50  ← Same customer
- Sale 3: Priya Sharma (9876543211) - ₹75
- Sale 4: Walk-in (no info) - ₹30
- Sale 5: Walk-in (no info) - ₹45

**Result:**
- Unique customers: 2 (Rajesh, Priya)
- Walk-ins: 2
- **Total Today's Customers: 4** ✅

## 🗄️ Database Triggers

### Trigger 1: `trigger_link_sale_to_customer`
**Purpose:** Link sales to existing customers automatically

**When:** BEFORE INSERT on sales table

**Logic:**
```sql
IF customer_phone IS PROVIDED THEN
    Find customer by phone
    IF customer EXISTS THEN
        Set sale.customer_id = customer.id
    END IF
END IF
```

**Benefit:** Automatic relationship between sales and customers

---

### Trigger 2: `trigger_update_customer_stats`
**Purpose:** Update customer purchase statistics

**When:** AFTER INSERT on sales table

**Logic:**
```sql
IF customer_phone IS PROVIDED THEN
    IF customer EXISTS THEN
        UPDATE customers SET
            total_purchases = total_purchases + sale.total_amount
            last_purchase_date = sale.sale_date
    ELSE IF customer_name IS PROVIDED THEN
        INSERT new customer with initial stats
    END IF
END IF
```

**Updates:**
- `total_purchases` - Cumulative purchase amount
- `last_purchase_date` - Most recent purchase
- `updated_at` - Timestamp of update

## 📝 Usage in POS

### When Creating a Sale:

**Option 1: Customer with Phone**
```typescript
{
  customer_name: "Rajesh Kumar",
  customer_phone: "9876543210",
  // ... other sale data
}
```
**Result:**
- ✅ Sale linked to customer automatically
- ✅ Customer stats updated
- ✅ Counted as 1 unique customer

**Option 2: Customer with Name Only**
```typescript
{
  customer_name: "John Doe",
  customer_phone: null,
  // ... other sale data
}
```
**Result:**
- ⚠️ Not linked to customer table
- ⚠️ Counted by name only
- ⚠️ Stats not updated

**Option 3: Walk-in Customer**
```typescript
{
  customer_name: null,
  customer_phone: null,
  // ... other sale data
}
```
**Result:**
- ✅ Sale recorded
- ✅ Counted as walk-in
- ℹ️ Each walk-in counted separately
