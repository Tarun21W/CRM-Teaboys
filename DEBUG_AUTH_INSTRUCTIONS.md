# 🔧 Auth Role Fix Applied

## ✅ What I Fixed:

### 1. **Layout.tsx** - Removed Default 'cashier' Fallback
- **Before**: `profile?.role || 'cashier'` - This was showing "cashier" when profile wasn't loaded
- **After**: Only shows navigation items when profile is actually loaded
- Changed display to show "loading..." instead of defaulting to "cashier"

### 2. **authStore.ts** - Added Better Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks
- Added console logs to debug profile loading
- Better error messages if profile fetch fails

### 3. **App.tsx** - Added Auth State Listener
- Now listens for auth state changes
- Automatically refreshes profile when you log in
- Ensures profile is always in sync with auth state

## 🎯 Database Status:
All user roles are **CORRECT** in the database:
- ✅ admin@teaboys.com → **admin** role
- ✅ manager@teaboys.com → **manager** role  
- ✅ cashier@teaboys.com → **cashier** role
- ✅ baker@teaboys.com → **baker** role

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Now:

### Step 1: Clear Everything
1. **Sign out** if you're logged in
2. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
   - Select "Cookies and other site data" and "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"
3. **Close all browser tabs** with the app
4. **Restart your dev server** if it's running

### Step 2: Fresh Login
1. Open the app in a **new browser tab**
2. Log in with: `admin@teaboys.com` / `admin123`
3. **Open browser console** (F12) and check for the log: `Profile loaded: {role: "admin", ...}`

### Step 3: Verify
After login, you should see:
- ✅ Name: **"Admin User"**
- ✅ Role badge: **"admin"** (not "cashier")
- ✅ **All 7 menu items**: Dashboard, POS, Products, Purchases, Production, Reports, **Users**
- ✅ Console log showing: `Profile loaded: {role: "admin", ...}`

## 🐛 If Still Showing "cashier":

Check the browser console (F12) for:
1. Any error messages
2. The `Profile loaded:` log - what role does it show?
3. Any network errors when fetching from `/rest/v1/profiles`

Then let me know what you see in the console!

## 📝 Test Other Accounts:
- **Manager**: manager@teaboys.com / manager123 (should see 6 items, no Users)
- **Cashier**: cashier@teaboys.com / cashier123 (should see 2 items: Dashboard, POS)
- **Baker**: baker@teaboys.com / baker123 (should see 3 items: Dashboard, Production)
