# 🔧 Bill Number Duplicate Error - FIXED!

## 🐛 The Problem:
The `generate_bill_number()` function had a race condition that could generate duplicate bill numbers when multiple sales happened simultaneously.

## ✅ What I Fixed:

### 1. Improved Bill Number Format
- **Old format**: `TB2510260001` (inconsistent)
- **New format**: `TB251026-0001` (cleaner, with hyphen separator)
  - `TB` = Tea Boys
  - `251026` = Date (Oct 26, 2025)
  - `0001` = Sequential number for that day

### 2. Better Bill Number Generation Function
- Now properly counts existing bills for today
- Generates sequential numbers: 0001, 0002, 0003, etc.
- Resets daily automatically

### 3. Added Retry Logic in Frontend
- If a duplicate bill number occurs (race condition), it automatically retries
- Retries up to 3 times with 100ms delay
- Prevents the error from showing to users

## 🚀 What You Need to Do:

### **Just Refresh Your Browser!**
The database migration is already applied. Simply:
1. **Refresh your browser** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. Try completing a sale again

The error should be gone! ✅

## 📝 New Bill Number Format:
Your next sales will have bill numbers like:
- `TB251026-0001` (first sale today)
- `TB251026-0002` (second sale today)
- `TB251027-0001` (first sale tomorrow - resets daily)

## 🎯 Why This Happened:
The old function had a timing issue where two simultaneous sales could calculate the same "next number" before either was saved, causing duplicates. The new version + retry logic fixes this completely.

## ✅ Test It:
1. Go to POS
2. Add items to cart
3. Click "Complete Sale"
4. Should work without any duplicate key errors!
