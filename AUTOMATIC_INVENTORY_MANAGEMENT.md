## 🎯 How It Works:

### When You Make a Purchase:

**Example: Buy 5kg of Sugar @ ₹200/kg**

1. **Purchase Created:**
   - Purchase number generated
   - Total amount: ₹1,000

2. **Inventory Automatically Updated:**
   - Sugar stock: 2kg → **7kg** ✅
   - Weighted avg cost updated
   - Stock ledger entry created

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Old: 2kg @ ₹200/kg = ₹400
   - New: 5kg @ ₹200/kg = ₹1,000
   - Total: 7kg @ ₹200/kg = ₹1,400
   - **New weighted avg: ₹200/kg** ✅

### When You Make a Sale:

**Example: Sell 2 cups of Dum Tea @ ₹15/cup**

1. **Sale Created:**
   - Bill number generated
   - Total: ₹30

2. **Finished Product Deducted:**
   - Dum Tea: 10 pcs → **8 pcs** ✅

3. **Raw Materials Deducted (with unit conversion):**
   - Milk: 2L → **1.9L** (deducted 100ml = 0.1L) ✅
   - Sugar: 7kg → **6.98kg** (deducted 20g = 0.02kg) ✅
   - Tea Powder: 2kg → **1.98kg** (deducted 20g = 0.02kg) ✅

4. **Cost & Profit Calculated:**
   - Cost: ₹11 per cup × 2 = ₹22
   - Revenue: ₹15 per cup × 2 = ₹30
   - **Profit: ₹8** ✅

### When You Make Production:

**Example: Produce 10 cups of Dum Tea**

1. **Production Run Created:**
   - Batch number generated
   - Quantity: 10 cups

2. **Raw Materials Deducted (with unit conversion):**
   - Milk: 2L → **1.5L** (deducted 500ml = 0.5L) ✅
   - Sugar: 7kg → **6.9kg** (deducted 100g = 0.1kg) ✅
   - Tea Powder: 2kg → **1.9kg** (deducted 100g = 0.1kg) ✅

3. **Finished Product Added:**
   - Dum Tea: 0 pcs → **10 pcs** ✅

4. **Production Cost Calculated:**
   - Cost per cup: ₹11
   - Total cost: ₹11 × 10 = **₹110** ✅

## 📊 Stock Ledger Tracking:

Every inventory movement is logged:

```sql
SELECT * FROM stock_ledger ORDER BY transaction_date DESC LIMIT 10;
```

Shows:
- Transaction type (purchase, sale, production)
- Product
- Quantity (+ for additions, - for deductions)
- Balance after transaction
- Reference (purchase/sale/production ID)
- Notes with details
- Created by (user)

## 🔍 Weighted Average Cost:

### How It's Calculated:

**Formula:**
```
New Weighted Avg = ((Old Stock × Old Cost) + (New Qty × New Cost)) / Total Stock
```

**Example:**
- Current: 2kg @ ₹200/kg = ₹400
- Purchase: 5kg @ ₹220/kg = ₹1,100
- Total: 7kg = ₹1,500
- **New Weighted Avg: ₹1,500 ÷ 7kg = ₹214.29/kg** ✅

This ensures accurate cost tracking even when purchase prices vary!

## ✅ Benefits:

1. **Automatic Updates** - No manual stock management needed
2. **Unit Conversion** - Handles ml/L, g/kg automatically
3. **Accurate Costing** - Weighted average cost always up-to-date
4. **Full Audit Trail** - Every movement logged in stock ledger
5. **Profit Tracking** - Real-time profit calculation
6. **Error Prevention** - Can't sell more than available stock
7. **Consistency** - Same logic for all transactions

## 🎯 What You Need to Do:

**Nothing!** 

Just use the system normally:
- Make purchases → Stock increases automatically ✅
- Make sales → Stock decreases automatically ✅
- Make production → Ingredients decrease, finished goods increase ✅

Everything is handled by database triggers!

## 📝 Verification:

### Check Stock Movements:
```sql
SELECT 
  p.name,
  sl.transaction_type,
  sl.quantity,
  sl.balance_qty,
  sl.transaction_date
FROM stock_ledger sl
JOIN products p ON p.id = sl.product_id
ORDER BY sl.transaction_date DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check Current Stock:
```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  current_stock,
  unit,
  weighted_avg_cost
FROM products
WHERE is_active = true
ORDER BY name;
```

## 🚨 Important Notes:

### 1. Stock Can Go Negative
- If you sell more than available, stock goes negative
- System shows warning but allows transaction
- Fix by making a purchase or stock adjustment

### 2. Weighted Average Cost
- Updates only on purchases
- Not recalculated on deletions (too complex)
- Reflects true average cost of inventory

### 3. Unit Conversion
- Recipe units can differ from product units
- System automatically converts
- Supported: ml↔L, g↔kg, cup↔ml

### 4. Stock Ledger
- Permanent record of all movements
- Cannot be edited (audit trail)
- Use for reconciliation and reporting

## 🎉 Result:

Your inventory is now **fully automated** with:
- ✅ Automatic stock updates
- ✅ Unit conversion
- ✅ Cost tracking

No manual inventory management needed! 🚀
