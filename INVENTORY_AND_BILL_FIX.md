# 🔧 MAJOR FIXES: Inventory Updates + Bill Number Duplicates

## 🐛 Two Critical Issues Fixed:

### Issue 1: Inventory Not Decreasing After Sales ❌
**Problem**: Products were being sold but stock levels weren't updating!
**Root Cause**: Missing database trigger to update inventory

### Issue 2: Duplicate Bill Number Errors ❌
**Problem**: "Failed to create sale after retries" - duplicate key constraint violations
**Root Cause**: Race condition in bill number generation (multiple sales at same time)

## ✅ What I Fixed:

### 1. **Added Inventory Update Triggers**
Now when a sale is completed:
- ✅ Product stock automatically decreases by the quantity sold
- ✅ Trigger runs on `sales_lines` table after INSERT
- ✅ Also added reverse trigger to restore stock if sale is deleted

**Example**:
- Coffee stock: 80 units
- Sell 3 coffees → Stock becomes 77 units automatically!

### 2. **Fixed Bill Number Generation with Advisory Locking**
- ✅ Uses PostgreSQL advisory locks to prevent race conditions
- ✅ Guarantees unique bill numbers even with simultaneous sales
- ✅ Proper regex matching for bill number format
- ✅ Format: `TB251026-0001`, `TB251026-0002`, etc.

### 3. **Added Safety Checks**
- ✅ Prevents negative stock (throws error if insufficient stock)
- ✅ Automatic stock restoration if sale is deleted
- ✅ Transaction-level locking for bill numbers

## 🚀 What You Need to Do:

### **Just Refresh Your Browser!**
The database migrations are already applied. Simply:
1. **Refresh your browser** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. Try completing a sale

## ✅ What Should Happen Now:

### When You Complete a Sale:
1. ✅ Bill number generates successfully (no more duplicates!)
2. ✅ Sale is saved to database
3. ✅ **Product stock automatically decreases**
4. ✅ Success message shows
5. ✅ Cart clears

### Example Test:
1. Check Coffee stock: Currently **80 units**
2. Add 3 coffees to cart
3. Complete sale
4. Go to Products page
5. Coffee stock should now be **77 units** ✅

## 🎯 Technical Details:

### New Database Triggers:
- `trigger_update_inventory_on_sale` - Decreases stock on sale
- `trigger_restore_inventory_on_sale_delete` - Restores stock if sale deleted

### New Bill Number Function:
- Uses `pg_advisory_xact_lock()` for transaction-level locking
- Prevents duplicate bill numbers completely
- Lock is automatically released after transaction

## 📝 Test It Now:

1. **Go to POS**
2. **Add items to cart** (note their current stock first)
3. **Complete Sale** (should work without errors!)
4. **Go to Products page** - verify stock decreased!

## 🔍 Verify Stock Updates:

Before sale:
```
Coffee: 80 units
Masala Tea: 100 units
Samosa: 50 units
```

After selling 3 coffees:
```
Coffee: 77 units ✅ (decreased by 3)
Masala Tea: 100 units (unchanged)
Samosa: 50 units (unchanged)
```

Both issues are now completely fixed! 🎉
