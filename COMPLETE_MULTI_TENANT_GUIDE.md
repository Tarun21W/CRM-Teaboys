# Complete Multi-Tenant System - Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

Your Tea Boys application is now a **fully functional multi-tenant system** with complete data isolation for 3 stores.

---

## üè™ 3 Independent Stores

### 1. Tea Boys - Main Branch (MAIN)
- **Location:** Main Street, City Center
- **Phone:** +91-9876543210
- **Independent POS, Inventory, Sales**

### 2. Tea Boys - North Branch (NORTH)
- **Location:** North Avenue, Sector 5
- **Phone:** +91-9876543211
- **Independent POS, Inventory, Sales**

### 3. Tea Boys - South Branch (SOUTH)
- **Location:** South Road, Market Area
- **Phone:** +91-9876543212
- **Independent POS, Inventory, Sales**

---

## üîí Complete Data Isolation

### What's Isolated Per Store:
‚úÖ **Products & Inventory** - Each store has its own product catalog
‚úÖ **Sales & POS** - Separate sales records and billing
‚úÖ **Customers** - Store-specific customer database
‚úÖ **Purchases & Suppliers** - Independent procurement
‚úÖ **Production Runs** - Store-specific production
‚úÖ **Wastage Tracking** - Separate wastage records
‚úÖ **Expiration Batches** - Store-specific batch tracking
‚úÖ **Stock Adjustments** - Independent inventory management
‚úÖ **Reports & Analytics** - Store-specific insights

### How It Works:
- **Database Level:** Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce isolation
- **Application Level:** Store context automatically applied
- **User Level:** Users can only access their assigned store's data

---

## üë• User Management & Access Control

### User Roles & Store Assignment

#### 1. **Store-Specific Users** (Cashier, Baker, Manager)
**Access:**
- ‚ùå Cannot see other stores' data
- ‚ùå Cannot switch stores
- ‚úÖ Full access to their assigned store
- ‚úÖ Can perform all operations in their store

**How to Assign:**
```sql
-- Assign user to Main Branch
UPDATE profiles 
SET store_id = (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'MAIN'),
    role = 'cashier'  -- or 'baker', 'manager'
WHERE full_name = 'John Doe';
```

#### 2. **Admin Users** (Multi-Store Access)
**Access:**
- ‚úÖ Can see ALL stores' data
- ‚úÖ Can switch between stores
- ‚úÖ Access to Multi-Store Analytics dashboard
- ‚úÖ Can manage users across all stores

**How to Make Admin:**
```sql
-- Make user an admin with multi-store access
UPDATE profiles 
SET can_access_all_stores = true,
    role = 'admin',
    store_id = (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'MAIN')  -- default store
WHERE full_name = 'Admin User';
```

## üì± User Interface Features

---

## üîß Admin Tasks

### 1. Create New User for a Store

```sql
-- First, create auth user in Supabase Auth dashboard
-- Then assign to store:

INSERT INTO profiles (id, full_name, role, store_id, can_access_all_stores)
VALUES (
  'auth-user-uuid',
  'Jane Smith',
  'cashier',
  (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'NORTH'),
  false
);
```

### 2. Transfer User to Different Store

```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET store_id = (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'SOUTH')
WHERE full_name = 'Jane Smith';
```

### 3. Promote User to Manager

```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'manager'
WHERE full_name = 'Jane Smith';
```

### 4. Make User Admin (Multi-Store Access)

```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET can_access_all_stores = true,
    role = 'admin'
WHERE full_name = 'Jane Smith';
```

### 5. View Users by Store

```sql
SELECT 
  p.full_name,
  p.role,
  s.name as store_name,
  p.can_access_all_stores as is_admin
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN stores s ON p.store_id = s.id
ORDER BY s.name, p.role;
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Data Isolation

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS policies that:
- ‚úÖ Automatically filter data by store_id
- ‚úÖ Prevent cross-store data access
- ‚úÖ Allow admins to access all stores
- ‚úÖ Enforce at database level (cannot be bypassed)

### Automatic Store Assignment
Triggers automatically set store_id on:
- Products
- Sales
- Purchases
- Production Runs
- Wastage
- Stock Adjustments
- And all other transactional data

### Testing Data Isolation

**Test 1: Regular User Cannot See Other Stores**
```sql
-- Login as store-specific user
-- Try to query another store's data
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE store_id != get_user_store_id();
-- Result: Empty (RLS blocks it)
```

**Test 2: Admin Can See All Stores**
```sql
-- Login as admin
SELECT store_id, COUNT(*) FROM sales GROUP BY store_id;
-- Result: Shows all stores' data
```

---

## üìà Reports & Analytics

### Store-Specific Reports
When a regular user views reports:
- ‚úÖ Only their store's data
- ‚úÖ Predictions based on their store
- ‚úÖ Expiration tracking for their store
- ‚úÖ Inventory levels for their store

### Multi-Store Reports (Admin)
Admins can:
1. **Switch stores** to view individual store reports
2. **Access Multi-Store Analytics** for consolidated view
3. **Compare performance** across stores
4. **Identify trends** and best practices

---

## üîÑ Data Migration & Setup

### Migrate Existing Data to Stores

```sql
-- Assign all existing products to Main Branch
UPDATE products 
SET store_id = (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'MAIN')
WHERE store_id IS NULL;

-- Assign all existing sales to Main Branch
UPDATE sales 
SET store_id = (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'MAIN')
WHERE store_id IS NULL;

-- Repeat for other tables...
```

### Clone Products to Another Store

```sql
-- Copy products from Main to North Branch
INSERT INTO products (
  name, category_id, sku, unit, selling_price, 
  current_stock, weighted_avg_cost, reorder_level,
  is_raw_material, is_finished_good, shelf_life_days, store_id
)
SELECT 
  name, category_id, sku, unit, selling_price,
  0 as current_stock,  -- Start with 0 stock
  weighted_avg_cost, reorder_level,
  is_raw_material, is_finished_good, shelf_life_days,
  (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'NORTH') as store_id
FROM products
WHERE store_id = (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'MAIN')
  AND is_active = true;
```

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: User Can't See Any Data

**Cause:** User not assigned to a store

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check user's store assignment
SELECT id, full_name, store_id, can_access_all_stores
FROM profiles
WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- Assign to a store
UPDATE profiles 
SET store_id = (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'MAIN')
WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

### Issue: Admin Can't Switch Stores

**Cause:** `can_access_all_stores` is false

**Solution:**
```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET can_access_all_stores = true
WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

### Issue: Store Selector Not Showing

**Reasons:**
1. User is not an admin
2. Only one store exists
3. User has access to only one store

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT 
  can_access_all_stores,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stores WHERE is_active = true) as total_stores
FROM profiles
WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

### Issue: Wrong Store Data Showing

**Solution:**
1. Check store selector in top-right
2. Verify correct store is selected
3. Refresh page
4. Clear browser cache if needed
