# 🎯 Recipe Ingredient Auto-Deduction - IMPLEMENTED!

## ✅ What Was Added:

### Automatic Raw Material Deduction on Sales
When you sell a **finished product** (like Masala Tea) through POS, the system now **automatically deducts** the raw materials used in its recipe!

## 🔄 How It Works:

### Example: Selling Masala Tea

**Recipe for Masala Tea (makes 10 cups):**
- Tea Powder: 50g
- Milk: 500ml
- Sugar: 100g
- Masala Spices: 20g

**When you sell 3 cups of Masala Tea:**

1. ✅ **Finished Product Stock Decreases:**
   - Masala Tea: -3 cups

2. ✅ **Raw Materials Auto-Deduct (Proportionally):**
   - Tea Powder: -15g (50g × 3/10)
   - Milk: -150ml (500ml × 3/10)
   - Sugar: -30g (100g × 3/10)
   - Masala Spices: -6g (20g × 3/10)

3. ✅ **Stock Ledger Records Everything:**
   - All deductions are logged with reference to the sale
   - Notes show which product was sold and the recipe used

## 📋 Database Triggers Created:

### 1. `trigger_update_inventory_on_sale` (Runs First)
- Deducts the finished product from inventory
- Example: Masala Tea stock decreases by 3

### 2. `trigger_deduct_recipe_ingredients` (Runs Second)
- Checks if the product has a recipe
- Calculates proportional ingredient quantities needed
- Deducts each raw material from inventory
- Logs all deductions in stock ledger

## 🎯 What This Means For You:

### Before (Manual):
1. Sell Masala Tea → Stock decreases
2. You manually track raw materials used ❌
3. Raw material stock becomes inaccurate ❌

### Now (Automatic):
1. Sell Masala Tea → Stock decreases ✅
2. System automatically deducts tea powder, milk, sugar, spices ✅
3. Raw material stock stays accurate ✅
4. Full audit trail in stock ledger ✅

## 📊 Stock Ledger Tracking:

Every ingredient deduction is logged with:
- Transaction type: "sale"
- Quantity: Negative (deduction)
- Reference: Sale ID
- Notes: "Auto-deducted for sale of [Product Name]"
- Balance: Updated stock level

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

### 1. Only Works for Products with Recipes
- If a product doesn't have a recipe, only the finished product stock is deducted
- Raw materials are only deducted if a recipe exists

### 2. Proportional Calculation
- System calculates based on batch size
- Example: Recipe makes 10 cups, you sell 3 → uses 30% of ingredients

### 3. Stock Warnings
- If raw material stock goes negative, a warning is logged
- You'll see this in the stock ledger

### 4. Finished Goods Only
- Only applies to products marked as "Finished Good"
- Raw materials sold directly don't trigger recipe deductions

## 🧪 Test It:

### Step 1: Create a Recipe
1. Go to **Production** page
2. Create a recipe for a finished product (e.g., Masala Tea)
3. Add ingredients with quantities

### Step 2: Check Current Stock
1. Go to **Products** page
2. Note the current stock of:
   - Finished product (e.g., Masala Tea: 100 cups)
   - Raw materials (e.g., Tea Powder: 5000g)

### Step 3: Make a Sale
1. Go to **POS**
2. Sell the finished product (e.g., 3 cups of Masala Tea)
3. Complete the sale

### Step 4: Verify Deductions
1. Go back to **Products** page
2. Check stock levels:
   - ✅ Masala Tea: 97 cups (decreased by 3)
   - ✅ Tea Powder: 4985g (decreased by 15g)
   - ✅ Milk: decreased proportionally
   - ✅ Sugar: decreased proportionally

### Step 5: Check Stock Ledger (Optional)
1. Query the stock ledger to see all deductions
2. Each ingredient will have a transaction logged

## 🎉 Benefits:

1. ✅ **Accurate Inventory** - Raw materials always reflect actual usage
2. ✅ **No Manual Tracking** - System handles everything automatically
3. ✅ **Full Audit Trail** - Every deduction is logged
4. ✅ **Proportional Calculations** - Works for any quantity sold
5. ✅ **Reorder Alerts** - Low stock alerts work correctly for raw materials
6. ✅ **Cost Tracking** - Accurate COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### If ingredients aren't being deducted:
1. Check if the product has a recipe (Production page)
2. Verify the product is marked as "Finished Good"
3. Check if recipe has ingredients added
4. Look for warnings in stock ledger

### If stock goes negative:
- This means you sold more than you had in raw materials
- System will log a warning
- You should purchase more raw materials

The system is now fully automated! 🚀
