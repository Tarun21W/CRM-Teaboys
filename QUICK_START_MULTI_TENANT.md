---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Assign Users to Stores

Run these SQL commands in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Example: Assign a cashier to Main Branch
UPDATE profiles 
SET store_id = (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'MAIN'),
    role = 'cashier',
    can_access_all_stores = false
WHERE full_name = 'Cashier Name';

-- Example: Assign a baker to North Branch
UPDATE profiles 
SET store_id = (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'NORTH'),
    role = 'baker',
    can_access_all_stores = false
WHERE full_name = 'Baker Name';

-- Example: Make someone an admin (access all stores)
UPDATE profiles 
SET can_access_all_stores = true,
    role = 'admin',
    store_id = (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'MAIN')
WHERE full_name = 'Admin Name';
```

### Step 2: Test Data Isolation

1. **Login as store-specific user** (cashier/baker/manager)
   - You should only see your store's data
   - No store selector visible
   - All operations are store-specific

2. **Login as admin**
   - Store selector appears in top-right
   - Can switch between stores
   - Access "Multi-Store" analytics from sidebar

### Step 3: Use Multi-Store Analytics

**For Admins Only:**
1. Click **"Multi-Store"** in the sidebar
2. View consolidated metrics across all stores
3. Compare store performance
4. Identify trends and opportunities

## üéØ Common Tasks

### View All Users and Their Stores
```sql
SELECT 
  p.full_name,
  p.role,
  s.name as store_name,
  p.can_access_all_stores as is_admin
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN stores s ON p.store_id = s.id
ORDER BY s.name, p.role;
```

### Check Store Sales Today
```sql
SELECT 
  s.name as store,
  COUNT(sa.id) as orders,
  SUM(sa.total_amount) as revenue
FROM sales sa
JOIN stores s ON sa.store_id = s.id
WHERE DATE(sa.sale_date) = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY s.name;
```

### View Low Stock Items by Store
```sql
SELECT 
  s.name as store,
  p.name as product,
  p.current_stock,
  p.reorder_level
FROM products p
JOIN stores s ON p.store_id = s.id
WHERE p.current_stock <= p.reorder_level
  AND p.is_active = true
ORDER BY s.name, p.current_stock;
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### User Can't See Any Data
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check and assign store
UPDATE profiles 
SET store_id = (SELECT id FROM stores WHERE code = 'MAIN')
WHERE id = 'user-uuid-here';
```

### Admin Can't Switch Stores
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Enable multi-store access
UPDATE profiles 
SET can_access_all_stores = true
WHERE id = 'user-uuid-here';
```

### Store Selector Not Showing
**Reasons:**
- User is not an admin
- User has `can_access_all_stores = false`

**Solution:** Make user an admin (see Step 1)
